In the semester, I got an A+ in **Linear Algebra(Honor)** and **Academic Writing and Ethics**.

I finished [**Bookstore**](https://github.com/Seven-Streams/Bookstore),a project of **Programming(2023Fall),ACM Honor Class**.

I learnt some basic knowledge of **Game Theory** and **Cryptography**.

Our student band(**Function Main**) gave performances("红日(Hongri)" and "春日影(haruhikage)") to other students.
